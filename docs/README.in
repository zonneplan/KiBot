## Introduction

KiBot is a program which helps you to generate the fabrication and
documentation files for your KiCad projects easily, repeatable, and
most of all, scriptably. This means you can use a Makefile to export
your KiCad PCBs just as needed, or do it in a CI/CD environment.

For example, it's common that you might want for each board rev:

* Check ERC/DRC one last time (using [KiCad Automation Scripts](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-automation-scripts/))
* Gerbers, drills and drill maps for a fab in their favourite format
* Fab docs for the assembler, including the BoM (Bill of Materials), costs spreadsheet and board view
* Pick and place files
* PCB 3D model in STEP, VRML and PCB3D formats
* PCB 3D render in PNG format
* Compare PCB/SCHs
* Panelization
* Stencil creation

You want to do this in a one-touch way, and make sure everything you need to
do so is securely saved in version control, not on the back of an old
datasheet.

KiBot lets you do this. The following picture depicts the data flow:

![KiBot Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/Esquema.png)

If you want to see this concept applied to a real world project visit the [Spora CI/CD](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-ci-test-spora) example.

## Installation

KiBot main target is Linux, but some users successfully use it on Windows. For Windows you'll need to install tools to mimic a Linux environment.
Running KiBot on MacOSX should be possible now that KiCad migrated to Python 3.x.

You can also run KiBot using docker images in a CI/CD environment like GitHub or GitLab. In this case you don't need to install anything locally.

### Dependencies

Notes:
- When installing from the [Debian repo](https://set-soft.github.io/debian/) you don't need to worry about dependencies, just pay attention to *recommended* and *suggested* packages.
- When installing using `pip` the dependencies marked with ![PyPi dependency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/PyPI_logo_simplified-22x22.png) will be automatically installed.
- The dependencies marked with ![Auto-download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/auto_download-22x22.png) can be downloaded on-demand by KiBot.
  Note this is poorly tested and is mostly oriented to 64 bits Linux systems. Please report problems.
- The `kibot-check` tool can help you to know which dependencies are missing.
- Note that on some systems (i.e. Debian) ImageMagick disables PDF manipulation in its `policy.xml` file.
  Comment or remove lines like this: `<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />` (On Debian: `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml`)
- ![Debian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/debian-openlogo-22x22.png) Link to Debian stable package.
- ![Python module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/Python-logo-notext-22x22.png) This is a Python module, not a separated tool.
- ![Tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/llave-inglesa-22x22.png) This is an independent tool, can be a binary or a Python script.

@dependencies@

### Installation on Ubuntu or Debian

The easiest way is to use the [repo](https://set-soft.github.io/debian/), but if you want to manually install the individual `.deb` files you can:

Get the Debian package from the [releases section](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/releases) and run:
```shell
sudo apt install ./kibot*_all.deb
```

**Important note**: Sometimes the release needs another packages that aren't part of the stable Debian distribution.
In this case the packages are also included in the release page. As an example version 0.6.0 needs:

```shell
sudo apt install ./python3-mcpy_2.0.2-1_all.deb ./kibot_0.6.0-1_all.deb
```

**Important note**: The [KiCad Automation Scripts](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-automation-scripts/) packages are a mandatory dependency.
The [KiBoM](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBoM), [InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/InteractiveHtmlBom) and [PcbDraw](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/PcbDraw) are recommended.

### Installation using pip

```shell
pip install --no-compile kibot
```

Note that `pip` has the dubious idea of compiling everything it downloads.
There is no advantage in doing it and it interferes with the `mcpy` macros.
Also note that in modern Linux systems `pip` was renamed to `pip3`, to avoid confusion with `pip` from Python 2.

If you are installing at system level I recommend generating the compilation caches after installing.
As `root` just run:

```shell
kibot --help-outputs > /dev/null
```

Note that `pip` will automatically install all the needed Python dependencies.
But it won't install other interesting dependencies.
In particular you should take a look at the [KiCad Automation Scripts](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-automation-scripts/) dependencies.
If you have a Debian based OS I strongly recommend trying to use the `.deb` packages for all the tools.

If you want to install the code only for the current user add the `--user` option.

If you want to install the last git code from GitHub using pip use:

```shell
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot.git
```

You can also clone the repo, change to its directory and install using:

```shell
pip3 install --user -e .
```

In this way you can change the code and you won't need to install again.

### Notes about virtualenv

If you try to use a Python virtual environment you'll need to find a way to make the KiCad module (`pcbnew`) available on it.
I don't know how to make it.

In addition: note that the virtual env will change the system share data paths. They will no longer point to things like `/usr/share/`
but to a virtual env place. So you'll need to either define environment variables to tell KiBot where are the libs or just add
symlinks from the virtual env to the system level libs.

### Installation on other targets

- Install KiCad 5.1.6 or newer
- Install Python 3.5 or newer
- Install the Python Yaml and requests modules
- Run the script *src/kibot*

## Configuration

KiBot uses a configuration file where you can specify what *outputs* to
generate and which preflight (before *launching* the outputs generation)
actions to perform. By default you'll generate all of them, but you can specify which
ones from the command line.

The configuration file should be named using the **.kibot.yaml** suffix,
i.e. *my_project.kibot.yaml*. The format used is [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
This is basically a text file with some structure.
This file can be compressed using *gzip* file format.

If you never used YAML read the following [explanation](docs/KiPlotYAML.md).
Note that the explanation could be useful even if you know YAML.

### Quick start

If you want to *learn by examples*, or you just want to take a look a what
KiBot can do, you can use the `--quick-start` command line option.

First change to the directory where your project (or projects) is located.
Now run KiBot like this:

```shell
kibot --quick-start
```

This will look for KiCad projects starting from the current directory and
going down the directory structure. For each project found KiBot will
generate a configuration file showing some common outputs. After creating
the configuration files KiBot will start the outputs generation.

Here is an [example](https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog_site/Browse/t1-navigate.html)
of what's generated using the following [example repo](https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog/).

You can use the generated files as example of how to configure KiBot.
If you want to just generate the configuration files and not the outputs
use:

```shell
kibot --quick-start --dry
```

If you want to know about all the possible options for all the available
outputs you can try:

```shell
kibot --example
```

This will generate a configuration file with all the available outputs
and all their options.

### Section order

The file is divided in various sections. Some of them are optional.

The order in which they are declared is not relevant, they are interpreted in the following order:

- `kiplot`/`kibot` see [The header](#the-header)
- `import` see [Importing outputs from another file](#importing-outputs-from-another-file),
  [Importing filters and variants from another file](#importing-other-stuff-from-another-file) and
  [Importing internal templates](#importing-internal-templates)
- `global` see [Default global options](#default-global-options)
- `filters` see [Filters and variants](#filters-and-variants)
- `variants` see [Filters and variants](#filters-and-variants)
- `preflight` see [The *preflight* section](#the-preflight-section)
- `outputs` see [The *outputs* section](#the-outputs-section)
- `groups` see [Grouping outputs](#grouping-outputs)

### The header

All configuration files must start with:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1
```

This tells to KiBot that this file is using version 1 of the format.

### The *preflight* section

This section is used to specify tasks that will be executed before generating any output.

#### @preflight@

Here is an example of a *preflight* section:

```yaml
preflight:
  run_erc: true
  update_xml: true
  run_drc: true
  check_zone_fills: true
  ignore_unconnected: false
```

#### More about *pcb_replace* and *sch_replace*

These options are supposed to be used in a version control environment.
This is because, unlike other options, they modify the PCB and/or schematic and might damage them.
In a version control environment you can just roll-back the changes.

Don't be afraid, they make a back-up of the files and also tries to disable dangerous changes.
But should be used carefully. They are ideal for CI/CD environment where you don't actually commit any changes.

#### Filtering DRC and ERC errors

Sometimes KiCad reports DRC or ERC errors that you can't get rid off.
This could be just because you are part of a team including lazy people that doesn't want to take the extra effort to solve
some errors that aren't in fact errors, just small violations made on purpose. In this case you could exclude some known errors.

For this you must declare `filters` entry in the `preflight` section. Then you can add as many `filter` entries as you want.
Each filter entry has an optional description and defines to which error type is applied (`number`) and a regular expression
that the error must match to be ignored (`regex`). Like this:

```yaml
  filters:
    - filter: 'Optional filter description'
      error: 'Error_type'
      regex:  'Expression to match'
```

Here is a KiCad 5 example, suppose you are getting the following errors:

```
** Found 1 DRC errors **
ErrType(4): Track too close to pad
    @(177.185 mm, 78.315 mm): Track 1.000 mm [Net-(C3-Pad1)] on F.Cu, length: 1.591 mm
    @(177.185 mm, 80.715 mm): Pad 2 of C3 on F.Cu and others

** Found 1 unconnected pads **
ErrType(2): Unconnected items
    @(177.185 mm, 73.965 mm): Pad 2 of C4 on F.Cu and others
    @(177.185 mm, 80.715 mm): Pad 2 of C3 on F.Cu and others
```

And you want to ignore them. You can add the following filters:

```yaml
  filters:
    - filter: 'Ignore C3 pad 2 too close to anything'
      error: '4'
      regex:  'Pad 2 of C3'
    - filter: 'Ignore unconnected pad 2 of C4'
      error: '2'
      regex:  'Pad 2 of C4'
```

If you need to match text from two different lines in the error message try using `(?s)TEXT(.*)TEXT_IN_OTHER_LINE`.

If you have two or more different options for a text to match try using `(OPTION1|OPTION2)`.

A complete Python regular expressions explanation is out of the scope of this manual. For a complete reference consult the [Python manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

KiCad 6 uses strings to differentiate errors, use them for the `error` field. To keep compatibility you can use the `number` or `error_number` options for KiCad 5.

Note that this will ignore the errors, but they will be reported as warnings.
If you want to suppress these warnings take a look at [Filtering KiBot warnings](#filtering-kibot-warnings)

**Important note**: this will create a file named *kibot_errors.filter* in the output directory.


### Default global options

The section `global` contains default global options that affects all the outputs.
Currently only a few option are supported.

#### Default *output* option

This option controls the default file name pattern used by all the outputs. This makes all the file names coherent.
You can always choose the file name for a particular output.

The pattern uses the following expansions:

- **%c** company from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%C`n`** comments line `n` from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%d** pcb/sch date from metadata if available, file modification date otherwise.
- **%D** date the script was started.
- **%f** original pcb/sch file name without extension.
- **%F** original pcb/sch file name without extension. Including the directory part of the name.
- **%g** the `file_id` of the global variant.
- **%G** the `name` of the global variant.
- **%i** a contextual ID, depends on the output type.
- **%I** an ID defined by the user for this output.
- **%M** directory where the pcb/sch resides. Only the last component i.e. /a/b/c/name.kicad_pcb -> c
- **%p** title from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%r** revision from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%S** sub-PCB name (related to multiboards).
- **%T** time the script was started.
- **%x** a suitable extension for the output type.
- **%v** the `file_id` of the current variant, or the global variant if outside a variant scope.
- **%V** the `name` of the current variant, or the global variant if outside a variant scope.

They are compatible with the ones used by IBoM.
The default value for `global.output` is `%f-%i%I%v.%x`.
If you want to include the revision you could add the following definition:

```yaml
global:
  output: '%f_rev_%r-%i.%x'
```

Note that the following patterns: **%c**, **%C`n`**, **%d**, **%f**, **%F**, **%p** and **%r** depends on the context.
If you use them for an output related to the PCB these values will be obtained from the PCB.
If you need to force the origin of the data you can use **%bX** for the PCB and **%sX** for the schematic, where
**X** is the pattern to expand.

You can also use text variables (introduced in KiCad 6). To expand a text variable use `${VARIABLE}`.
In addition you can also use environment variables, defined in your OS shell or defined in the `global` section.

#### Default *dir* option

The default `dir` value for any output is `.`. You can change it here.

Expansion patterns are allowed.

Note that you can use this value as a base for output's `dir` options. In this case the value defined in the `output` must start with `+`.
In this case the `+` is replaced by the default `dir` value defined here.

#### Default *variant* option

This option controls the default variant applied to all the outputs. Example:

```yaml
global:
  variant: 'production'
```

#### Default *units* option

This option controls the default value for the `position` and `bom` outputs.
If you don't define it then the internal defaults of each output are applied. But when you define it the default is the defined value.

On KiCad 6 the dimensions has units. When you create a new dimension it uses *automatic* units. This means that KiCad uses the units currently selected.
This selection isn't stored in the PCB file. The global `units` value is used by KiBot instead.

#### Output directory option

The `out_dir` option can define the base output directory. This is the same as the `-d`/`--out-dir` command line option.
Note that the command line option has precedence over it.

Expansion patterns are applied to this value, but you should avoid using patterns that expand according to the context, i.e. **%c**, **%d**, **%f**, **%F**, **%p** and **%r**.
The behavior of these patterns isn't fully defined in this case and the results may change in the future.

You can also use text variables (introduced in KiCad 6). To expand a text variable use `${VARIABLE}`.
In addition you can also use environment variables, defined in your OS shell or defined in the `global` section.

#### Date format option

* The **%d**, **%sd** and **%bd** patterns use the date and time from the PCB and schematic.
  When abscent they use the file timestamp, and the `date_time_format` global option controls the format used.
  When available, and in ISO format, the `date_format` controls the format used.
  You can disable this reformatting assigning `false` to the `date_reformat` option.
* The **%D** format is controlled by the `date_format` global option.
* The **%T** format is controlled by the `time_format` global option.

In all cases the format is the one used by the `strftime` POSIX function, for more information visit this [site](https://strftime.org/).

#### PCB details options

The following variables control the default colors and they are used for documentation purposes:

- `pcb_material` [FR4] PCB core material.
  Currently known are FR1 to FR5
- `solder_mask_color` [green] Color for the solder mask.
  Currently known are green, black, white, yellow, purple, blue and red.
- `silk_screen_color` [white] Color for the markings.
  Currently known are black and white.
- `pcb_finish` [HAL] Finishing used to protect pads.
  Currently known are None, HAL, HASL, ENIG and ImAg.

#### Filtering KiBot warnings

KiBot warnings are marked with `(Wn)` where *n* is the warning id.

Some warnings are just recommendations and you could want to avoid them to focus on details that are more relevant to your project.
In this case you can define filters in a similar way used to [filter DRC/ERC errors](#filtering-drc-and-erc-errors).

As an example, if you have the following warning:

```
WARNING:(W43) Missing component `l1:FooBar`
```

You can create the following filter to remove it:

```yaml
global:
  filters:
    - number: 43
      regex:  'FooBar'
```

#### All available global options

global:
@global_options@

### Filters and variants

The filters and variants are mechanisms used to modify the circuit components.
Both concepts are closely related. In fact variants can use filters.

The current implementation of the filters allow to exclude components from some of the processing stages. The most common use is to exclude them from some output.
You can also change components fields/properties and also the 3D model.

Variants are currently used to create *assembly variants*. This concept is used to manufacture one PCB used for various products.
You can learn more about KiBot variants on the following [example repo](https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog/).
The example is currently using KiCad 6, if you want to see the example files for KiCad 5 go [here](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/tree/KiCad5/).

As mentioned above the current use of filters is to mark some components. Mainly to exclude them, but also to mark them as special.
This is the case of *do not change* components in the BoM.

Filters and variants are defined in separated sections. A filter section looks like this:

```yaml
filters:
 - name: 'a_short_name'
   type: 'generic'
   comment: 'A description'
   # Filter options
```

#### @filters@


#### Examples for filters

The [tests/yaml_samples](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples) directory contains all the regression tests. Many of them test the filters functionality.

- [int_bom_exclude_any.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_exclude_any.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use regular expressions to match fields and exclude components. Is the more powerful filter mechanism.
- [int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml): Shows various mechanisms. In particular how to change the list of keywords, usually used to match 'DNF', meaning you can exclude components with arbitrary text.
- [int_bom_fil_2.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_fil_2.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use KiCad 5 module attributes (from the PCB) to filter SMD, THT and Virtual components. Note KiCad 6 is redefining the attributes.
- [int_bom_include_only.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_include_only.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use regular expressions to match only some components, instead of including a few.
- [int_bom_var_t2is_csv.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_var_t2is_csv.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use filters and variants simultaneously, not a good idea, but possible.
- [print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml): Shows how to change the `dnf_filter` for a KiBoM variant.
- [print_pdf_no_inductors_2.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/print_pdf_no_inductors_2.kibot.yaml): Shows how to do what `print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml` does but without the need of a variant.

#### Built-in filters

- **_datasheet_link** converts Datasheet fields containing URLs into HTML links
- **_expand_text_vars** is a default `expand_text_vars` filter
- **_kibom_dnc_Config** it uses the internal `dnc_list` to exclude components with
  - Value matching any of the keys
  - Any of the keys in the `Config` field (comma or space separated)
- **_kibom_dnf_Config** it uses the internal `dnf_list` to exclude components with
  - Value matching any of the keys
  - Any of the keys in the `Config` field (comma or space separated)
- **_kicost_dnp** used emulate the way KiCost handles the `dnp` field.
  - If the field is 0 the component is included, otherwise excluded.
- **_kicost_rename** is a `field_rename` filter that applies KiCost renamings.
  - Includes all `manf#` and `manf` variations supported by KiCost
  - Includes all distributor part number variations supported by KiCost
  - 'version' -> 'variant'
  - 'nopop' -> 'dnp'
  - 'description' -> 'desc'
  - 'pdf' -> 'datasheet'
- **_mechanical** is used to exclude:
  - References that start with #
  - Virtual components
  - References that match: '^TP[0-9]*' or '^FID'
  - Part names that match: 'regex': 'mount.*hole' or 'solder.*bridge' or 'solder.*jump' or 'test.*point'
  - Footprints that match:  'test.*point' or 'mount.*hole' or 'fiducial'
- **_none** does nothing, useful when you want to remove a filter with default value
- **_only_smd** is used to get only SMD parts
- **_only_tht** is used to get only THT parts
- **_only_virtual** is used to get only virtual parts
- **_rot_footprint** is a default `rot_footprint` filter
- **_var_rename** is a default `var_rename` filter
- **_var_rename_kicost** is a default `var_rename_kicost` filter

Note that the **_kibom_...** filters uses a field named `Config`, but you can customise them invoking **_kibom_dnf_FIELD**. This will create an equivalent filter, but using the indicated **FIELD**.

#### Changing the 3D model, simple mechanism

This mechanism allows small changes to the 3D model. Is simple to use, but the information is located in the schematic.

If a component defines the field `_3D_model` then its value will replace the 3D model.
You can use `var_rename` or `var_rename_kicost` filter to define this field only for certain variants.
In this way you can change the 3D model according to the component variant.

When the component has more than one 3D model you must provide a comma separated list of models to replace the current models.

#### Changing the 3D model, complex mechanism

When the a component has a long list of 3D models and you want to keep all the information in the PCB you can use this mechanism.

The information is stored in the `Text items` of the footprint. If you want to change the 3D models for certain variant you must add an item containing:

```
%VARIANT_NAME:SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN%
```

Where `VARIANT_NAME` is the name of the variant that will change the list of 3D models.
The `SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN` is a comma separated list of 3D model positions in the list of 3D models.
All the slots listed will be enabled, the rest will be disabled.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD).
In this example we have a display whose aspect and connectio can radically change according to the variant.
We have two variants:

- `left`, uses a ERM1602DNS-2.1 with a connector on the left and two other pins on the right
- `top`, uses a WH1602B-TMI-JT# with a single connector on the top

We have the following list of 3D models:

```
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_2x07_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x16_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KIPRJMOD}/steps/WH1602B-TMI-JT#.step
${KIPRJMOD}/steps/ERM1602DNS-2.1.step
```

The ERM1602DNS-2.1 uses slots 1, 3, 4 and 6. So the effective list will be:

```
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_2x07_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x01_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KIPRJMOD}/steps/ERM1602DNS-2.1.step
```

The WH1602B-TMI-JT# uses slots 2 and 5. So the effective list will be:

```
${KISYS3DMOD}/Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm.3dshapes/PinHeader_1x16_P2.54mm_Vertical.wrl
${KIPRJMOD}/steps/WH1602B-TMI-JT#.step
```

To achieve it we define the following texts in the footprint: `%left:1,3,4,6%` and `%top:2,5%`.
Here are both variants:

![Left variant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD/output/lcd-3D_top_variant_left.png)

![Top variant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/samples/3D_Model_LCD/output/lcd-3D_top_variant_top.png)

If you preffer to use the variant specific matching mechanism you can use the following syntax:

```
$TEXT_TO_MATCH:SLOT1,SLOT2,SLOTN$
```

In this case the variant will be applied to the `TEXT_TO_MATCH`, if it matches (equivalent to a component fitted) the `SLOT` will be used.

Some important notes:
- If you want to control what models are used when no variant is used you'll need to create a `default` variant.
  This is what the above example does. In this case the `default` variant shows all the connectors, but no display.
  Note that changing the 3D model needs the variants infrastructure.
- If you are using variants and a lot of them select the same slots you can add a special text: `%_default_:SLOTS%`.
  This will be used if none %VARIANT_NAME:SLOT%` matched.
- If you want to disable a model and avoid any kind of warning add `_Disabled_by_KiBot` to the 3D model path.
  This could be needed if you want to remove some model and you don't want to adjust the slot numbers.
- This mechanism can be used with any of the available variants. For this reason we use the `VARIANT_NAME` and we
  avoid relying on any variant specific mechanism. But you can use the alternative syntax if you preffer the variant
  specific matching system.

#### DNF and DNC internal keys

The current list of **DNF** keys is:
- dnf
- dnl
- dnp
- do not fit
- do not place
- do not load
- nofit
- nostuff
- noplace
- noload
- not fitted
- not loaded
- not placed
- no stuff

The current list of **DNC** keys is:
- dnc
- do not change
- no change
- fixed

You can define your own lists as the `int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml` shows.


### The *outputs* section

In this section you put all the things that you want to generate.
This section contains one or more **outputs**.
Each output contain the following data:

- `name` a name so you can easily identify it.
- `comment` a short description of this output.
- `type` selects which type of output will be generated.
  Examples are *gerbers*, *drill files* and *pick & place files*
- `dir` is the directory where this output will be stored.
- `extends` used to use another output's `options` as base.
- `run_by_default` indicates this output will be created when no specific outputs are requested.
- `disable_run_by_default` can be used to disable the `run_by_default` status of other output.
- `output_id` text to use for the %I expansion content.
- `options` contains one or more options to configure this output.
- `layers` a list of layers used for this output. Not all outputs needs this subsection.

**Important note about the layers**: In the original [kiplot](https://github.com/johnbeard/kiplot)
(from [John Beard](https://github.com/johnbeard)) the name of the inner layers was *Inner.N* where
*N* is the number of the layer, i.e. *Inner.1* is the first inner layer.
This format is supported for compatibility.
Note that this generated a lot of confusion because the default KiCad name for the first inner layer
is *In1.Cu*.
People filled issues and submitted pull-requests to fix it, thinking that inner layers weren't supported.
Currently KiCad allows renaming these layers, so this version of kiplot supports the name used in
KiCad. Just use the same name you see in the user interface.

The available values for *type* are:
- Plot formats:
    - `gerber` the gerbers for fabrication.
    - `ps` postscript plot
    - `hpgl` format for laser printers
    - `svg` scalable vector graphics

Here is an example of a configuration file to generate the gerbers for the top and bottom layers:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

preflight:
  run_drc: true

outputs:

  - name: 'gerbers'
    comment: "Gerbers for the board house"
    type: gerber
    dir: gerberdir
    options:
      # generic layer options
      exclude_edge_layer: false
      exclude_pads_from_silkscreen: false
      plot_sheet_reference: false
      plot_footprint_refs: true
      plot_footprint_values: true
      force_plot_invisible_refs_vals: false
      tent_vias: true
      line_width: 0.15

      # gerber options
      use_aux_axis_as_origin: false
      subtract_mask_from_silk: true
      use_protel_extensions: false
      gerber_precision: 4.5
      create_gerber_job_file: true
      use_gerber_x2_attributes: true
      use_gerber_net_attributes: false

    layers:
      - 'F.Cu'
      - 'B.Cu'
```

Most options are the same you'll find in the KiCad dialogs.

Outputs are generated in the order they are declared in the YAML file.
To create them in an arbitrary order use the `--cli-order` command line option and they will be created in the order specified in the command line.


#### Specifying the layers

You have various ways to specify the layers. If you need to specify just one layer you can just use its name:

```yaml
    layers: 'F.Cu'
```

If you want to specify all the available layers:

```yaml
    layers: 'all'
```

You can also select the layers you want in KiCad (using File, Plot dialog) and save your PCB.
Then you just need to use:

```yaml
    layers: 'selected'
```

You can also use any of the following grup of layers:

- **copper** all the copper layers
- **technical** all the technical layers (silk sreen, solder mask, paste, adhesive, etc.)
- **user** all the user layers (draw, comments, eco, margin, edge cuts, etc.)

You can also mix the above definitions using a list:

```yaml
    layers:
      - 'copper'
      - 'Dwgs.User'
```

This will select all the copper layers and the user drawings.
Note that the above mentioned options will use file name suffixes and descriptions selected automatically.
If you want to use a particular suffix and provide better descriptions you can use the following format:

```yaml
    layers:
      - layer: 'F.Cu'
        suffix: 'F_Cu'
        description: 'Front copper'
      - layer: 'B.Cu'
        suffix: 'B_Cu'
        description: 'Bottom copper'
```

You can also mix the styles:

```yaml
    layers:
      - 'copper'
      - layer: 'Cmts.User'
        suffix: 'Cmts_User'
        description: 'User comments'
      - 'Dwgs.User'
```

If you need to use the same list of layers for various outputs you can use YAML anchors.
The first time you define the list of layers just assign an anchor, here is an example:

```yaml
    layers: &copper_and_cmts
      - copper
      - 'Cmts.User'
```

Next time you need this list just use an alias, like this:

```yaml
    layers: *copper_and_cmts
```

#### Consolidating BoMs

Some times your project is composed by various boards, other times you are producing various products at the same time.
In both cases you would want to consolidate the components acquisition in one operation.
Of course you can create individual BoMs for each project in CSV format and then consolidate them using a spreadsheet editor.
But KiBot offers another option: you create a BoM for your main project and then aggregate the components from the other projects.

Here is a simple example. Suppose you have three projects: *merge_1*, *merge_2* and *merge_3*.
For the *merge_1* project you could use the following output:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

outputs:
  - name: 'bom_csv'
    comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
    type: bom
    dir: BoM
    options:
      use_alt: true
```

Using the `tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_1.sch` from the git repo and storing the above example in `m1.kibot.yaml` you could run:

```shell
src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_1.sch -d test_merge
```

And get `test_merge/BoM/merge_1-bom.csv`:

This CSV says you have five components groped in three different types.
They are one 1 nF capacitor, one 10 nF capacitor and three 1 k resistors.
Now lets generate BoMs for the *merge_2* example:

```shell
src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch -d test_merge
```

We'll get `test_merge/BoM/merge_2-bom.csv`:

In this project we have six components from four different types.
They are similar to *merge_1* but now we also have a 10 k resistor.
We don't need to generate this BoM to consolidate our projects, but is good to know what we have.
And now lets generate BoMs for the *merge_3* example:

```shell
src/kibot -c m1.kibot.yaml -e tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch -d test_merge
```

We'll get `test_merge/BoM/merge_3-bom.csv`:

| Row                | Description                       | Part | References | Value | Footprint | Quantity Per PCB | Status | Datasheet |

This time we also have five components, but from two different types.
They are one 1 k resistor and four 10 k resistors.
Now suppose we want to create 10 boards for *merge_1*, 20 for *merge_2* and 30 for *merge_3*.
We could use the following configuration:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

outputs:
  - name: 'bom_csv'
    comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
    type: bom
    dir: BoM
    options:

      number: 10
      aggregate:
        - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch

You can see that now we have much more stats.
They say we have four different types, thirteen for board sets, a total of 60 boards and 250 components.
Then we have individual stats for each project.
The capacitors are easy to interpret, we have 30 1 nF capacitors *merge_1* project has one and *merge_2* another.
As we have 10 *merge_1* and 20 *merge_2* boards this is clear.
But looking at the 1 k resistors is harder. We have 80, three from *merge_1*, one from *merge_2* and another from *merge_3*.
So we have 10*3+20*3+30=120, this is clear, but the BoM says they are R1-R3 R2-R4 R5, which is a little bit confusing.
In this simple example is easy to correlate R1-R3 to *merge_1*, R2-R4 to *merge_2* and R5 to *merge_1*.
For bigger projects this gets harder.
Lets assign an *id* to each project, we'll use 'A' for *merge_1*, 'B' for *merge_2* and 'C' for *merge_3*:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

outputs:
  - name: 'bom_csv'
    comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
    type: bom
    dir: BoM
    options:
      use_alt: true
      number: 10
      ref_id: 'A:'
      aggregate:
        - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch
          number: 20
          ref_id: 'B:'
        - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch
          number: 30
          ref_id: 'C:'
```

Now `test_merge_consolidate/BoM/merge_1-bom.csv` will have the following information:

| Row | Description           | Part | References               | Value | Footprint | Quantity Per PCB | Build Quantity | Status | Datasheet | Source BoM                       |
|-----|-----------------------|------|--------------------------|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 1   | Unpolarized capacitor | C    | A:C1 B:C2                | 1nF   |           | 2                | 30             |        | ~         | merge_1(1) merge_2(1)            |
| 2   | Unpolarized capacitor | C    | A:C2 B:C1                | 10nF  |           | 2                | 30             |        | ~         | merge_1(1) merge_2(1)            |
| 3   | Resistor              | R    | A:R1-A:R3 B:R2-B:R4 C:R5 | 1k    |           | 7                | 120            |        | ~         | merge_1(3) merge_2(3) merge_3(1) |
| 4   | Resistor              | R    | B:R1 C:R1-C:R4           | 10k   |           | 5                | 140            |        | ~         | merge_2(1) merge_3(4)            |

As you can see now we know `A` has R1-R3, `B` R2-R4 and for `C` R5 is the 1k resistor.
If we want to compact the `Source BoM` column we just need to enable the `source_by_id` option:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

outputs:
  - name: 'bom_csv'
    comment: "Bill of Materials in CSV format"
    type: bom
    dir: BoM
    options:
      use_alt: true
      number: 10
      ref_id: 'A:'
      source_by_id: true
      aggregate:
        - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_2.sch
          number: 20
          ref_id: 'B:'
        - file: tests/board_samples/kicad_5/merge_3.sch
          number: 30
          ref_id: 'C:'
```

And we'll get:

| Row | Description           | Part | References               | Value | Footprint | Quantity Per PCB | Build Quantity | Status | Datasheet | Source BoM        |
|-----|-----------------------|------|--------------------------|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1   | Unpolarized capacitor | C    | A:C1 B:C2                | 1nF   |           | 2                | 30             |        | ~         | A:(1) B:(1)       |
| 2   | Unpolarized capacitor | C    | A:C2 B:C1                | 10nF  |           | 2                | 30             |        | ~         | A:(1) B:(1)       |
| 3   | Resistor              | R    | A:R1-A:R3 B:R2-B:R4 C:R5 | 1k    |           | 7                | 120            |        | ~         | A:(3) B:(3) C:(1) |
| 4   | Resistor              | R    | B:R1 C:R1-C:R4           | 10k   |           | 5                | 140            |        | ~         | B:(1) C:(4)       |


#### Importing outputs from another file

In some cases you may want to reuse configuration files. An example of this are the example files that generate gerbers and drill files for various manufacturers ([see](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/docs/samples)).

In this case you can create a section named `import` containing a list of configuration files. Here is an example:

```yaml
import:
  - configs/Elecrow.kibot.yaml
  - configs/FusionPCB.kibot.yaml
  - configs/JLCPCB.kibot.yaml
  - configs/P-Ban.kibot.yaml
  - configs/PCBWay.kibot.yaml
```

This will import all the outputs from the listed files.


#### Importing other stuff from another file

This is a more complex case of the previous [Importing outputs from another file](#importing-outputs-from-another-file).
In this case you must use the more general syntax:

```yaml
import:
  - file: FILE_CONTAINING_THE_YAML_DEFINITIONS
    outputs: LIST_OF_OUTPUTS
    preflights: LIST_OF_PREFLIGHTS
    filters: LIST_OF_FILTERS
    variants: LIST_OF_VARIANTS
    global: LIST_OF_GLOBALS
    groups: LIST_OF_GROUPS
```

This syntax is flexible. If you don't define which `outputs`, `preflights`, `filters`, `variants`, `global` and/or `groups` all will be imported.
So you can just omit them, like this:

```yaml
import:
  - file: FILE_CONTAINING_THE_YAML_DEFINITIONS
```

The `LIST_OF_items` can be a YAML list or just one string. Here is an example:

```yaml
import:
  - file: FILE_CONTAINING_THE_YAML_DEFINITIONS
    outputs: one_name
    filters: ['name1', 'name2']
```

This will import the `one_name` output and the `name1` and `name2` filters. As `variants` is omitted, all variants will be imported.
The same applies to other things like globals and groups.
You can also use the `all` and `none` special names, like this:

```yaml
import:
  - file: FILE_CONTAINING_THE_YAML_DEFINITIONS
    outputs: all
    filters: all
    variants: none
    global: none
```

This will import all outputs and filters, but not variants or globals.
Also note that imported globals has more precedence than the ones defined in the same file.
If you want to give more priority to the local values use:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1
  imported_global_has_less_priority: true

import:
...
```

Another important detail is that global options that are lists gets the values merged.
The last set of values found is inserted at the beginning of the list.
You can collect filters for all the imported global sections.

It's recommended to always use some file extension in the *FILE_CONTAINING_THE_YAML_DEFINITIONS* name.
If you don't use any file extension and you use a relative path this name could be confused with an internal template.
See [Importing internal templates](#importing-internal-templates).
If you need to use a name without any extension and a relative path, and this name is the same used for a KiBot template use the `is_external` option:

```yaml
import:
  - file: Elecrow
    is_external: true
```


#### Importing internal templates

KiBot has some internally defined outputs, groups and filters.
You can easily use them with the `import` mechanism.
Use the `file` mechanism and don't include the extension for the file.
When importing an internal template you don't need to specify its location.
Here is an example:

```yaml
import:
  - file: Elecrow
```

This will import the definitions for the internal Elecrow configuration.
Here is a list of currently defined templates:

#### Using other output as base for a new one

If you need to define an output that is similar to another, and you want to avoid copying the options from the former, you can *extend* an output.
To achieve it just specify the name of the base output in the `extends` value.
Note that this will use the `options` of the other output as base, not other data as the comment.

Also note that you can use [YAML anchors](https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors), but this won't work if you are
importing the base output from other file.

Additionally you must be aware that extending an output doesn't disable the base output.
If you need to disable the original output use `disable_run_by_default` option.


#### Grouping outputs

Sometimes you want to generate various outputs together. An example could be the fabrication files, or the documentation for the project.

To explain it we will use an example where you have six outputs.
Three are used for fabrication: `gerbers`, `excellon_drill` and `position`.
Another three are used for documentation: `SVG`, `PcbDraw` and `PcbDraw2`.
The YAML config containing this example can be found [here](tests/yaml_samples/groups_1.kibot.yaml).
If you need to generate the fabrication outputs you must run:

```
kibot gerbers excellon_drill position
```

One mechanism to group the outputs is to create a `compress` output that just includes the outputs you want to group.
Here is one example:

```yaml
  - name: compress_fab
    comment: "Generates a ZIP file with all the fab outputs"
    type: compress
    run_by_default: false
    options:
      files:
        - from_output: gerbers
        - from_output: excellon_drill
        - from_output: position
```

The `compress_fab` output will generate the `gerbers`, `excellon_drill` and `position` outputs.
Then it will create a ZIP file containing the files generated by these outputs.
The command line invocation for this is:

```
kibot compress_fab
```

Using this mechanism you are forced to create a compressed output.
To avoid it you can use `groups`.
The `groups` section is used to create groups of outputs.
Here is the example for fabrication files:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: fab
    outputs:
      - gerbers
      - excellon_drill
      - position
```

So now you can just run:

```
kibot fab
```

The `gerbers`, `excellon_drill` and `position` outputs will be generated without the need to generate an extra file.
Groups can be nested, here is an example:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: fab
    outputs:
      - gerbers
      - excellon_drill
      - position
  - name: plot
    outputs:
      - SVG
      - PcbDraw
      - PcbDraw2
  - name: fab_svg
    outputs:
      - fab
      - SVG
```

Here the `fab_svg` group will contain `gerbers`, `excellon_drill`, `position` and `SVG`.

Groups can be imported from another YAML file.

Avoid naming groups using `_` as first character. These names are reserved for KiBot.

### Doing YAML substitution or preprocessing

Sometimes you could want to change values in the YAML depending on external stuff,
or just want to be able to change something for each variant run.

In this case you can use external tools to create various YAML files using a template,
but you can also use KiBot's definitions.

The definitions allows you to replace tags like `@VARIABLE@` by some specified value.
These definitions can be specified at the command line using the `-E` option.
As an example: `-E UNITS=millimeters` will replace all `@UNITS@` markers by `millimeters`.
This is applied to all YAML files loaded, so this propagates to all the imported YAML files.

You can use `-E` as many times as you need.

## Usage

For a quick start just go to the project's dir and run:

```shell
kibot --quick-start
```

This will generate a configuration and generate outputs.
If you want to just generate the configuration, and not the outputs, use:

```shell
kibot --quick-start --dry
```

If you need a more exhaustive configuration file try:

```shell
kibot --example
```

This will generate a file named `example.kibot.yaml` containing all the available options and comments about them.
You can use it to create your own configuration file.

If you want to use the layers of a particular PCB in the example use:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE --example
```

And if you want to use the same options selected in the plot dialog use:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE -p --example
```

If the current directory contains only one PCB file and only one configuration file (named *.kibot.yaml) you can just call `kibot`.
No arguments needed.
The tool will figure out which files to use.

If more than one file is found in the current directory `kibot` will use the first found and issue a warning.
If you need to use other file just tell it explicitly:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE.kicad_pcb -c CONFIG.kibot.yaml
```

A simple target can be added to your `makefile`, so you can just run `make pcb_files` or integrate into your current build process.

```Makefile
pcb_files:
    kibot -b $(PCB) -c $(KIBOT_CFG)
```

If you need to suppress messages use `--quiet` or `-q` and if you need to get more information about what's going on use `--verbose` or `-v`.

If you want to generate only some of the outputs use:

```shell
kibot OUTPUT_1 OUTPUT_2
```

If you want to generate all outputs with some exceptions use:


```shell
kibot --invert-sel OUTPUT_1 OUTPUT_2
```

Note that you can use the `run_by_default` option of the output you want to exclude from the default runs.

If you want to skip the DRC and ERC use:

```shell
kibot --skip-pre run_erc,run_drc
```

If you want to skip all the `preflight` tasks use:

```shell
kibot --skip-pre all
```

All outputs are generated using the current directory as base.
If you want to use another directory as base use:

```shell
kibot --out-dir OTHER_PLACE
```

If you want to list the available outputs defined in the configuration file use:

```shell
kibot --list
```

### Command line help

```
@cmd_help@
```

## Usage for CI/CD

When using a GitHub or GitLab repo you can use KiBot to generate all the needed stuff each time you commit a change to the schematic and/or PCB file.

If you want a quick demo of what KiBot can do on a GitHub project try the following [workflow](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/blob/master/.github/workflows/kibot_quick_start.yml).
You just need to enable GitHub workflows and copy this workflow to your `.github/workflows/` folder. In this mode KiBot will detect the project files, create a configuration and generate the targets.
This workflow collects the generated files in `Automatic_outputs.zip`.

Examples of how to use KiBot can be found [here for GitHub](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_ci_test) and [here for GitLab](https://gitlab.com/set-soft/kicad-ci-test).

In order to run KiBot on these environments you need a lot of software installed. The usual mechanism to achieve this is using [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Docker images containing KiBot, all the supporting scripts and a corresponding KiCad can be found in the
[kicad5_auto](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad5_auto),
[kicad6_auto](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad6_auto) and
[kicad7_auto](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad7_auto) GitHub packages.
More complete images, with Pandoc, LaTeX, Blender and testing tools, can be found in the following packages:
[kicad5_auto_full](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad5_auto_full),
[kicad6_auto_full](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad6_auto_full) and
[kicad7_auto_full](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad7_auto_full) GitHub packages.
Old images can be found at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as
[setsoft/kicad_auto](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_auto) and
[setsoft/kicad_auto_test](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_auto_test).

The images are based on
[kicad5_debian](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_debian/pkgs/container/kicad5_debian),
[kicad6_debian](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad6_debian) and
[kicad7_debian](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad7_debian).
([setsoft/kicad_debian](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_debian) on Docker Hub),
containing KiCad on Debian GNU/Linux.

If you need to run the current development version of KiBot you can use the following docker images:
[ghcr.io/inti-cmnb/kicad5_auto_full:dev](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad5_auto_full),
[ghcr.io/inti-cmnb/kicad6_auto_full:dev](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad6_auto_full) or
[ghcr.io/inti-cmnb/kicad7_auto_full:dev](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto/pkgs/container/kicad7_auto_full)
([setsoft/kicad_auto:dev](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_auto)).
These images are based on the *full* (also named *test*) images.

The most important images are:

| Name                                      | KiBot        | KiCad  |

### Usage of GitHub Actions

Note: You can also use --quick-start functionality with GitHub actions, an example is this
[workflow](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/blob/master/.github/workflows/kibot_action_quick_start.yml).
This is the fastest way to test KiBot functionality.

You need to put a [config.kibot.yaml](#configuration) file into the KiCad project folder.

Here is an example of workflow file using the GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: example

on:
  push:
    paths:
    - '**.sch'
    - '**.kicad_pcb'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.sch'
      - '**.kicad_pcb'

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: INTI-CMNB/KiBot@v2
      with:
        # Required - kibot config file
        config: config.kibot.yaml
        # optional - prefix to output defined in config
        dir: output
        # optional - schematic file
        schema: 'schematic.sch'
        # optional - PCB design file
        board: 'pcb.kicad_pcb'
    - name: upload results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: output
        path: output
```

For KiCad 6 use `v2_k6` instead of `v2` (`v2_k7` for KiCad 7).
These actions use the last KiBot stable release, to use the current development code use `v2_dk6` (KiCad 6) and `v2_d` (KiCad 5).

A working example applied to a repo can be found [here](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-ci-test-spora/tree/test_gh_action)
([spora_main.yml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-ci-test-spora/blob/test_gh_action/.github/workflows/spora_main.yml)).
Another example, but using variants can be found [here](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog)
([kibot_action.yml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/blob/master/.github/workflows/kibot_action.yml) for KiCad 6,
 [kibot_action.yml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog/blob/KiCad5/.github/workflows/kibot_action.yml) for KiCad 5)

The available options are:

- **additional_args**: Additional text to add to the KiBot invocation. This is intended for advanced use, report problems.
- **cache3D**: When `YES` you can cache the downloaded 3D models. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/set-soft/kibot_3d_models_cache_example/).
- **config**: The KiBot config file to use. The first file that matches `*.kibot.yaml` is used when omitted.
- **dir**: Output directory for the generated files. The current directory is used when omitted.
- **board**: Name of the PCB file. The first file that matches `*.kicad_pcb` is used when omitted.
- **install3D**: When `YES` installs the KiCad 3D models. Note that this will download more than 360 MiB and install more than 5 GiB of files.
- **quickstart**: When `YES` ignores all the other options and runs in `--quick-start` mode. No configuration needed.
- **schema**: Name of the schematic file. The first file that matches `*.*sch` is used when omitted.
- **skip**: Skip preflights, comma separated or *all*. Nothing is skipped when omitted.
- **targets**: List of targets to generate separated by spaces. To only run preflights use __NONE__. All targets are generated when omitted.
- **variant**: Global variant to use. No variant is applied when omitted.
- **verbose**: Level of verbosity. Valid values are 0, 1, 2 or 3. Default is 0.

#### GitHub Actions tags

There are several tags you can choose:

| Tag         | API | KiBot        | KiCad |
| :---------- | --- | ------------ | ----: |
| v1          |  1  | 1.2.0        | 5.1.9 |
| v1_k6       |  1  | 1.2.0        | 6.0.5 |
| v2_1_2_0    |  2  | 1.2.0        | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6_1_2_0 |  2  | 1.2.0        | 6.0.5 |
| v2_1_3_0    |  2  | 1.3.0        | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6_1_3_0 |  2  | 1.3.0        | 6.0.7 |
| v2_1_4_0    |  2  | 1.4.0        | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6_1_4_0 |  2  | 1.4.0        | 6.0.9 |
| v2_1_5_1    |  2  | 1.5.1        | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6_1_5_1 |  2  | 1.5.1        | 6.0.9 |
| v2_1_6_0    |  2  | 1.6.0        | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6_1_6_0 |  2  | 1.6.0        | 6.0.9 |
| v2          |  2  | last release | 5.1.9 |
| v2_k6       |  2  | last release | 6.x   |
| v2_k7       |  2  | last release | 7.x   |
| v2_d        |  2  | git code     | 5.1.9 |
| v2_dk6      |  2  | git code     | 6.x   |
| v2_dk7      |  2  | git code     | 7.x   |

The main differences between API 1 and 2 are:

- API 2 adds support for variants and quick-start
- In API 2 you can select which targets are created
- In API 1 you must specify the input files, in API 2 can be omitted
- API 1 supports wildcards in the filenames, API 2 doesn't
- API 2 supports spaces in the filenames, API 1 doesn't

Also note that v2 images are currently using the *full* docker image (v1.5 and newer).
It includes things like PanDoc and Blender.

### GitHub Cache

GitHub offers a mechanism to cache data between runs.
One interesting use is to make the KiCost prices cache persistent, here is an [example](https://github.com/set-soft/kicost_ci_test)

Another use is to cache [downloaded 3D models](https://github.com/set-soft/kibot_3d_models_cache_example)


## Contributing

If you find KiBot useful please consider contributing to the project. There various ways to contribute.
Of course donations are welcome ([donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=K2T86GDTTMRPL)), but there are other ways to contribute:

- In general:
  - Your workflow: What's missing in KiBot for your workflow? Comment it in the
    [discussions](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/discussions/categories/missing-in-my-workflow)
  - Configuration for a manufacturer: If you have a configuration known to work for a manufacturer please consider contributing it.
    Even if this is a small manufacurer, this helps to know what are the most common options.
  - Mention KiBot: If your project or company uses KiBot you can mention it, so people know about KiBot.
    Also if you are reporting a KiCad issue, currently KiCad developers doesn't pay much attention to automation details.
- If you are a Windows/Mac OS X user:
  - If you managed to run it locally consider contributing a tutorial of how to do it.
  - If you run KiBot on CI/CD and want to run it locally: consider investing some time on tests.
    Just comment in the [discussions](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/discussions/categories/other-platforms)
    and I'll help you to run tests to adapt the code.
    Now that KiCad 6 uses Python 3 most of KiBot functionality should work on Windows and Mac OS X.
    People is using WSL to run KiBot, but we don't have a tutorial about how to do it.
- If you use a Linux that isn't derived from Debian:
  - Consider helping to add better support for it. Do you know the name of the packages for the dependencies?
    Do you know how to create a package for your distro?
- If you are good writing tutorials:
  - Consider writing some tutorial about using KiBot. Some examples:
    - How to start using it
    - How to use filters/variants
    - How to create good BoMs
- If you know Python:
  - Create a new output: KiBot is modular, creating a new output can be done just using some of the `kibot/out_*` files as template.
    The outputs works as plugins and they are automatically discovered by KiBot. Note that you can add them to `~/.config/kibot/plugins`
  - Add regression tests: If you know about Python testing you can add tests to `tests/test_plot/`. We try to cover 100% of the code.
    Even simple tests that check the code executes are welcome.
- If you know HTML/CSS:
  - Internal BoM styles: You can just take a look at the generated HTMLs and contribute a CSS, or take a look at the code
    (`kibot/bom/html_writer.py`) and add more functionality.
  - Navigate results styles: Similar to the above but for the `navigate_results` output (`kibot/out_navigate_results.py`).
- If you have drawing skills:
  - Navigate results icons: Currently we have only one set of icons, they are from KiCad 6. Alternative icons are welcome.


## Notes about Gerber format

I found this topic poorly documented and quite complex. So here is what I know, feel free to send me any corrections.
Note that this is a very dynamic topic and this text was written in november 2020.

The gerber format is controlled by [Ucamco](https://www.ucamco.com/en/), a leading manufacturer of equipment and software for PCB fabrication.
Even when this isn't an open standard they release the spec for free and interact with Jean-Pierre Charras (father of KiCad).
So KiCad support for gerber format is really updated.

The gerber format evolved with time, here are the versions I know:

* **RS-274D** obsolete version of the format.
* **RS-274X** (aka **X1**) this is the *extended* version of the format. Is the most widely supported, but has some limitations.
* **X2** this is the format currently recommended by Ucamco and the default for modern KiCad versions.
  This extension adds important meta-data to the files. It helps CAM operators to know what's every drawing in the image.
  So you know which are pads, tracks, etc. And also more interesting information: impedance controlled tracks, the role of each file, etc.
  Using X2 you can know what is each file without the need of special names or file extensions.
  KiCad can generate drill files using X2.
* **X3** this is the current draft. One interesting addition is the *Components* role.
  These files replaces the position files, adding important information about the footprint.

In addition to them is the spec for the **Gerber Job** file. This file was introduced between X2 and X3, and is used to group all the gerber files.
The *gbrjob* file contains all the missing stack-up information.

KiCad 5 can generate X1, X2 and gerber job files, including drill information in gerber format.
KiCad 5.99 (6.0 pre-release) can also generate X3 files (position files in gerber format).

As you can see the idea of Ucamco is to unify all fabrication information in one format.

The **X2** format was designed in a way that software that fully implement **X1** can just ignore the added meta-data.
In an ideal world you shouldn't bother about it and generate **X2** files. Just use the **gbr** file extension and a *gbrjob* file.
The problem is with poorly implemented CAM tools. In particular **CAM350**, used by various important cheap China manufacturers.
This software has known issues interpretating aperture macros and some X2 data.
If your manufacturer has problems with your files check the following:

* Put gerber, drill and position files in the same directory.
* Disable **X2** extensions (`use_gerber_x2_attributes` set to `false`)
* Use arcaic role mechanism (`use_protel_extensions` set to `true`)
* Disable **aperture macros** (KiCad 6 only: `disable_aperture_macros` set to `true`)

The [kicad-gerberzipper](https://github.com/g200kg/kicad-gerberzipper) is an action plugin for KiCad oriented to help to generate gerber and drill files for some manufacturers.
I adapted the configurations from kicad-gerberzipper to KiBot configurations, they are available as [internal templates](#importing-internal-templates).


## Notes about the position file

Position files are quite simple. You can generate them as plain text (ASCII) or as a spreadsheet (CSV).

But some conventions can make them tricky. Some manufacturers, like [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), uses conventions that are incompatible with KiCad.

The [following blog](https://dubiouscreations.com/2019/10/21/using-kicad-with-jlcpcb-assembly-service/) explains how to adapt the position files generated by KiCad to what JLCPCB needs.
To achieve it the author uses a script called [JLCKicadTools](https://github.com/matthewlai/JLCKicadTools).

You can achieve the same using KiBot. Here is a configuration example that generates the BoM and position files in the same way JLCKicadTools does:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

filters:
  - name: only_jlc_parts
    comment: 'Only parts with JLC code'
    type: generic
    include_only:
      - column: 'LCSC#'
        regex: '^C\d+'

variants:
  - name: rotated
    comment: 'Just a place holder for the rotation filter'
    type: kibom
    variant: rotated
    pre_transform: _rot_footprint

outputs:
  - name: 'position'
    comment: "Pick and place file, JLC style"
    type: position
    options:
      variant: rotated
      output: '%f_cpl_jlc.%x'
      format: CSV
      units: millimeters
      separate_files_for_front_and_back: false
      only_smd: true
      columns:
        - id: Ref
          name: Designator
        - Val
        - Package
        - id: PosX
          name: "Mid X"
        - id: PosY
          name: "Mid Y"
        - id: Rot
          name: Rotation
        - id: Side
          name: Layer

  - name: 'bom'
    comment: "BoM for JLC"
    type: bom
    options:
      output: '%f_%i_jlc.%x'
      exclude_filter: 'only_jlc_parts'
      ref_separator: ','
      columns:
        - field: Value
          name: Comment
        - field: References
          name: Designator
        - Footprint
        - field: 'LCSC#'
          name: 'LCSC Part #'
      csv:
        hide_pcb_info: true
        hide_stats_info: true
        quote_all: true
```

The `only_jlc_parts` filter is used to generate the BoM and assumes you put the JLC component code in a field named `LCSC#` (JLC uses [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/) as supplier).
Note that the author of the blog simply used `Field4` for this and his script searches for any field containing the `^C\d+` pattern.
I think this isn't a good idea and I suggest using a defined name, like in this example.

The `rotated` variant is used only to apply the `_rot_footprint` transformation filter. This filter is an internal filter of type `rot_footprint`.
Here is the same configuration file making explicit use of the rotation filter:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

filters:
  - name: fix_rotation
    comment: 'Adjust rotation for JLC'
    type: rot_footprint

  - name: only_jlc_parts
    comment: 'Only parts with JLC code'
    type: generic
    include_only:
      - column: 'LCSC#'
        regex: '^C\d+'

variants:
  - name: rotated
    comment: 'Just a place holder for the rotation filter'
    type: kibom
    variant: rotated
    pre_transform: fix_rotation

outputs:
  - name: 'position'
    comment: "Pick and place file, JLC style"
    type: position
    options:
      variant: rotated
      output: '%f_cpl_jlc.%x'
      format: CSV
      units: millimeters
      separate_files_for_front_and_back: false
      only_smd: true
      columns:
        - id: Ref
          name: Designator
        - Val
        - Package
        - id: PosX
          name: "Mid X"
        - id: PosY
          name: "Mid Y"
        - id: Rot

```

As you can see we now create a filter named `fix_rotation` of type `rot_footprint`:

```yaml
  - name: fix_rotation
    comment: 'Adjust rotation for JLC'
    type: rot_footprint
```

Using it, instead of the internal filter named `_rot_footprint`, is the same here. But you can then customize the filter.

The filter supports the following options:

- `extend`: [boolean=true] Extends the internal list of rotations with the one provided. Otherwise just use the provided list.
- `negative_bottom`: [boolean=true] Rotation for bottom components is computed via subtraction as `(component rot - angle)`. Note that this should be coherent with the `bottom_negative_x` of the position output.
- `invert_bottom`: [boolean=false] Rotation for bottom components is negated, resulting in either: `(- component rot - angle)` or when combined with `negative_bottom`, `(angle - component rot)`.
- `rotations`: [list(list(string))] A list of pairs regular expression/rotation. Components matching the regular expression will be rotated the indicated angle. Special names `_top` and `_bottom` will match all components on that side of the board.

In order to add a new rotation or just change an existing one you just need to use the `rotations` option.
As an example: the internal list of rotations rotates QFN packages by 270 degrees, no suppose you want to rotate them just 90 degrees.
The filter will look like this:

```yaml
  - name: fix_rotation
    comment: 'Adjust rotation for JLC'
    type: rot_footprint
    rotations:
      - ["^QFN-", 90.0]
```

This regular expression will match any footprint starting with `QFN-` and rotate it 90 degrees.

The internal list of rotations is:

| Footprint                                           | Rotation |

### XYRS files

XYRS files are just BoM files in CSV format that includes pick and place data (**X** position, **Y** position, **R**otation and **S**ide).
You can generate them using the internal BoM generator (`bom` output).
The following fields contains the needed information:

- `Footprint X`
- `Footprint Y`
- `Footprint Rot`
- `Footprint Side`

Additionally we support:

- `Footprint Type` (SMD, THT, VIRTUAL)
- `Footprint X-Size`
- `Footprint Y-Size`
- `Footprint Populate`

Important: These files doesn't support manual panelization with repeated reference names, you'll get the coordinates for just one component because this is a BoM.

## Notes about 3D models

This section contains some notes and advices about the use of 3D models.
There are many strategies and you can choose the mix that better suits your needs.
If you have any suggestion don't hesitate in contacting me to add them.

### 3D models and docker images

The default KiCad 3D models aren't included in the KiBot docker images.
This is because the 3D models currently needs around 5 GB and the current docker images are between 1 and 2.8 GB.
So adding them means a huge increase in size.

This is not a big problem because KiBot will download any missing 3D model from KiCad's repo.

As a side effect you'll get errors and/or warnings about the missing 3D models and/or KiCad environment variables pointing to them.

If you need to install the KiCad 3D models in one of the `kicad_debian`, `kicad_auto` or `kicad_auto_test` images just run the
`/usr/bin/kicad_3d_install.sh` script included with the current images.

If you are running the GitHub action and you want to install the KiCad 3D models use the `install3D: YES` option.

### Caching downloaded 3D models

You can store the downloaded 3D models in a GitHub cache, an example can be found in the following
[repo](https://github.com/set-soft/kibot_3d_models_cache_example)

### Self contained projects

Try to make your project self contained.
If you are using a repo this means the repo should contain anything needed to work with your project.

KiCad 6 helps a lot in this regard. Now schematic files are self contained, you don't need external files to work with them.
Even with this I think including the used symbols and footprints isn't a bad idea.
If you expect other people to edit your project then is much simpler if the originals are in the project.

The 3D models are a very special case. KiCad doesn't help much in this regard.
I strongly suggest including all used 3D models in your repo.
You can then use `${KIPRJMOD}` as base for the path to the models, this will be expanded to the current path to your project.
So you can use things like `${KIPRJMOD}/3D/MODEL_NAME` and store all the 3D models in the *3D* folder inside your project folder.

### LCSC/JLCPCB/EasyEDA 3D models

KiBot can download 3D models for components that has an LCSC code and that has a 3D model at [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/).
If the 3D model is used locally, but not found in the repo, KiBot will try to download it.
Use the `field_lcsc_part` option if KiBot fails to detect the schematic field containing the LCSC code.

### 3D models aliases

This is a KiCad 6 feature that was removed in KiCad 7. If you use it please migrate to environment variables as KiCad 7 did.
If you still interested on it continue reading.

This is a very limited feature in KiCad. You can define an `ALIAS` and then use `ALIAS:MODEL_NAME`.
The `ALIAS` will say where to look for `MODEL_NAME`. This looks coherent with the way KiCad handles symbols and footprints.
But it currently has a huge limitation: this information is stored along with the user configuration and there is no way to
complement it at project level. I don't recommend using aliases because it makes quite complicated to create self contained
projects.

KiBot offers some mechanisms to help using aliases:

1. You can define your aliases in the `global` section using the `aliases_for_3d_models` option.
2. You can use environment and text variables to define aliases. This can be disabled using the `disable_3d_alias_as_env` option.

The problem with this is that you must keep two lists synchronized, one for KiCad and the other to make your project self contained.

### How to handle addons

KiCad 6 introduces a *Plugin and Content Manager*, they can contain footprints and 3D models.
Using 3D models aliases looks like a good solution here, but this isn't.
The best solution here is to use the `KICAD6_3RD_PARTY` variable.
Instead of defining an alias pointing to the content you can just use `${KICAD6_3RD_PARTY}/3dmodels/FULL_PLUGIN_NAME/MODEL_NAME`.
I know this is long, but this will make your project portable.
The user will need to download the plugin, but won't need to define any alias.

### Getting a self contained PCB

In order to help users to create self contained projects KiBot offers some help.
The following configuration:

```yaml
# Example KiBot config file
kibot:
  version: 1

outputs:
  - name: export_pcb
    comment: 'Copy 3D models'
    type: copy_files
    dir: 'expoted_pcb'
    options:
      files:
        - source_type: 3d_models
          dest: 3d_models+
          save_pcb: true
```

Will create a new PCB inside a directory called `expoted_pcb`, this PCB will use the 3D models copied to `expoted_pcb/3d_models` using
relative paths. So you can move the new PCB file to any place, as long as the `3d_models` directory is in the same place as the PCB.

## Proposed advanced KiCad usage

This section contains some proposed solutions for special, or advanced, KiCad usage.

### One circuit and more than one PCB implementation

Use hierarchical pages to share the circuit between two projects: [example](docs/1_SCH_2_diff_PCBs)

### System with more than one PCB

This case is [discussed here](docs/1_SCH_2_part_PCBs)
