## Introduction

KiBot is a program which helps you to generate the fabrication and
documentation files for your KiCad projects easily, repeatable, and
most of all, scriptably. This means you can use a Makefile to export
your KiCad PCBs just as needed.

For example, it's common that you might want for each board rev:

* Check ERC/DRC one last time (using [KiCad Automation Scripts](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-automation-scripts/))
* Gerbers, drills and drill maps for a fab in their favourite format
* Fab docs for the assembler, including the BoM (Bill of Materials)
* Pick and place files
* PCB 3D model in STEP format

You want to do this in a one-touch way, and make sure everything you need to
do so it securely saved in version control, not on the back of an old
datasheet.

KiBot lets you do this. The following picture depicts the data flow:

![KiBot Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/master/docs/images/Esquema.png)

**New on 0.7.0**:
Now KiBot supports *variants*. To my knowledge this is the first tool to implement such a feature, in a transparent way and from schematic to PCB, for KiCad.
To learn more about KiBot variants visit the [example repo](https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog/).

## Configuration

KiBot uses a configuration file where you can specify what *outputs* to
generate. By default you'll generate all of them, but you can specify which
ones from the command line.

The configuration file should be named using the **.kibot.yaml** suffix,
i.e. *my_project.kibot.yaml*. The format used is [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
This is basically a text file with some structure.
This file can be compressed using *gzip* file format.

If you never used YAML read the following [explanation](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/blob/master/docs/KiPlotYAML.md).
Note that the explanation could be useful even if you know YAML.

### The header

All configuration files must start with:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1
```

This tells to KiBot that this file is using version 1 of the format.

### The *preflight* section

This section is used to specify tasks that will be executed before generating any output.

#### Supported preflight options:

- check_zone_fills: [boolean=false] Zones are filled before doing any operation involving PCB layers.
- filters: [list(dict)] A list of entries to filter out ERC/DRC messages.
  * Valid keys:
    - `error`: [string=''] Error id we want to exclude. A name for KiCad 6 or a number for KiCad 5, but always a string.
    - *error_number*: Alias for number.
    - `filter`: [string=''] Name for the filter, for documentation purposes.
    - *filter_msg*: Alias for filter.
    - `number`: [number=0] Error number we want to exclude. KiCad 5 only.
    - `regex`: [string='None'] Regular expression to match the text for the error we want to exclude.
    - *regexp*: Alias for regex.
- ignore_unconnected: [boolean=false] Option for `run_drc`. Ignores the unconnected nets. Useful if you didn't finish the routing.
- run_drc: [boolean=false] Runs the DRC (Distance Rules Check). To ensure we have a valid PCB.
- run_erc: [boolean=false] Runs the ERC (Electrical Rules Check). To ensure the schematic is electrically correct.
- update_xml: [boolean=false] Update the XML version of the BoM (Bill of Materials).
        To ensure our generated BoM is up to date.
        Note that this isn't needed when using the internal BoM generator (`bom`).


Here is an example of a *preflight* section:

```yaml
preflight:
  run_erc: true
  update_xml: true
  run_drc: true
  check_zone_fills: true
  ignore_unconnected: false
```

#### Filtering DRC and ERC errors

Sometimes KiCad reports DRC or ERC errors that you can't get rid off.
This could be just because you are part of a team including lazzy people that doesn't want to take the extra effort to solve
some errors that aren't in fact errors, just small violations made on purpose. In this case you could exclude some known errors.

For this you must declare `filters` entry in the `preflight` section. Then you can add as many `filter` entries as you want.
Each filter entry has an optional description and defines to which error type is applied (`number`) and a regular expression
that the error must match to be ignored (`regex`). Like this:

```yaml
  filters:
    - filter: 'Optional filter description'
      error: 'Error_type'
      regex:  'Expression to match'
```

Here is a KiCad 5 example, suppose you are getting the following errors:

```
** Found 1 DRC errors **
ErrType(4): Track too close to pad
    @(177.185 mm, 78.315 mm): Track 1.000 mm [Net-(C3-Pad1)] on F.Cu, length: 1.591 mm
    @(177.185 mm, 80.715 mm): Pad 2 of C3 on F.Cu and others

** Found 1 unconnected pads **
ErrType(2): Unconnected items
    @(177.185 mm, 73.965 mm): Pad 2 of C4 on F.Cu and others
    @(177.185 mm, 80.715 mm): Pad 2 of C3 on F.Cu and others
```

And you want to ignore them. You can add the following filters:

```yaml
  filters:
    - filter: 'Ignore C3 pad 2 too close to anything'
      error: '4'
      regex:  'Pad 2 of C3'
    - filter: 'Ignore unconnected pad 2 of C4'
      error: '2'
      regex:  'Pad 2 of C4'
```

If you need to match text from two different lines in the error message try using `(?s)TEXT(.*)TEXT_IN_OTHER_LINE`.

If you have two or more different options for a text to match try using `(OPTION1|OPTION2)`.

A complete Python regular expressions explanation is out the scope of this manual. For a complete reference consult the [Python manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

KiCad 6 uses strings to differentiate errors, use them for the `error` field. To keep compatibility you can use the `number` or `error_number` options for KiCad 5.

**Important note**: this will create a file named *kibot_errors.filter* in the output directory.


### Default global options

The section `global` contains default global options that affects all the outputs.
Currently only one option is supported.

#### Default *output* option

This option controls the default file name pattern used by all the outputs. This makes all the file names coherent.
You can always choose the file name for a particular output.

The pattern uses the following expansions:

- **%f** original pcb/sch file name without extension.
- **%p** pcb/sch title from pcb metadata.
- **%c** company from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%r** revision from pcb/sch metadata.
- **%d** pcb/sch date from metadata if available, file modification date otherwise.
- **%D** date the script was started.
- **%T** time the script was started.
- **%i** a contextual ID, depends on the output type.
- **%x** a suitable extension for the output type.

They are compatible with the ones used by IBoM.
The default value for `global.output` is `%f-%i.%x`.
If you want to include the revision you could add the following definition:

```yaml
global:
  output: '%f_rev_%r-%i.%x'
```

#### Default *variant* option

This option controls the default variant applied to all the outputs. Example:

```yaml
global:
  variant: 'production'
```

#### Filtering KiBot warnings

KiBot warnings are marked with `(Wn)` where *n* is the warning id.

Some warnings are just recommendations and you could want to avoid them to focus on details that are more relevant to your project.
In this case you can define filters in a similar way used to [filter DRC/ERC errors](#filtering-drc-and-erc-errors).

As an example, if you have the following warning:

```
WARNING:(W43) Missing component `l1:FooBar`
```

You can create the following filter to remove it:

```yaml
global:
  filters:
    - number: 43
      regex:  'FooBar'
```

### Filters and variants

The filters and variants are mechanism used to modify the circuit components.
Both concepts are closely related. In fact variants can use filters.

The current implementation of the filters allow to exclude components from some of the processing stages. The most common use is to exclude them from some output.
In the future more advanced filters will allow modification of component details.

Variants are currently used to create *assembly variants*. This concept is used to manufature one PCB used for various products.
You can learn more about KiBot variants on the following [example repo](https://inti-cmnb.github.io/kibot_variants_arduprog/).

As mentioned above the current use of filters is to mark some components. Mainly to exclude them, but also to mark them as special.
This is the case of *do not change* components in the BoM.

Filters and variants are defined in separated sections. A filter section looks like this:

```yaml
filters:
 - name: 'a_short_name'
   type: 'generic'
   comment: 'A description'
   # Filter options
```

Currently the only type available is `generic`.

#### Supported filters:

- generic: Generic filter
        This filter is based on regular exressions.
        It also provides some shortcuts for common situations.
        Note that matches aren't case sensitive and spaces at the beggining and the end are removed.
  * Valid keys:
    - `comment`: [string=''] A comment for documentation purposes.
    - `config_field`: [string='Config'] Name of the field used to clasify components.
    - `config_separators`: [string=' ,'] Characters used to separate options inside the config field.
    - `exclude_all_hash_ref`: [boolean=false] Exclude all components with a reference starting with #.
    - `exclude_any`: [list(dict)] A series of regular expressions used to exclude parts.
                     If a component matches ANY of these, it will be excluded.
                     Column names are case-insensitive.
      * Valid keys:
        - `column`: [string=''] Name of the column to apply the regular expression.
        - *field*: Alias for column.
        - `regex`: [string=''] Regular expression to match.
        - *regexp*: Alias for regex.
    - `exclude_config`: [boolean=false] Exclude components containing a key value in the config field.
                        Separators are applied.
    - `exclude_empty_val`: [boolean=false] Exclude components with empty 'Value'.
    - `exclude_field`: [boolean=false] Exclude components if a field is named as any of the keys.
    - `exclude_refs`: [list(string)] List of references to be excluded.
                      Use R* for all references with R prefix.
    - `exclude_smd`: [boolean=false] KiCad 5: exclude components marked as smd in the PCB.
    - `exclude_tht`: [boolean=false] KiCad 5: exclude components marked as through-hole in the PCB.
    - `exclude_value`: [boolean=false] Exclude components if their 'Value' is any of the keys.
    - `exclude_virtual`: [boolean=false] KiCad 5: exclude components marked as virtual in the PCB.
    - `include_only`: [list(dict)] A series of regular expressions used to include parts.
                      If there are any regex defined here, only components that match against ANY of them will be included.
                      Column/field names are case-insensitive.
                      If empty this rule is ignored.
      * Valid keys:
        - `column`: [string=''] Name of the column to apply the regular expression.
        - *field*: Alias for column.
        - `regex`: [string=''] Regular expression to match.
        - *regexp*: Alias for regex.
    - `invert`: [boolean=false] Invert the result of the filter.
    - `keys`: [string|list(string)=dnf_list] [dnc_list,dnf_list] List of keys to match.
              The `dnf_list` and `dnc_list` internal lists can be specified as strings.
              Use `dnf_list` for ['dnf', 'dnl', 'dnp', 'do not fit', 'do not load', 'do not place', 'no stuff', 'nofit', 'noload', 'noplace', 'nostuff', 'not fitted', 'not loaded', 'not placed'].
              Use `dnc_list` for ['dnc', 'do not change', 'fixed', 'no change'].
    - `name`: [string=''] Used to identify this particular filter definition.



#### Examples for filters

The [tests/yaml_samples](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples) directory contains all the regression tests. Many of them test the filters functionality.

- [int_bom_exclude_any.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_exclude_any.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use regular expressions to match fields and exclude components. Is the more powerful filter mechanism.
- [int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml): Shows various mechanisms. In particular how to change the list of keywords, usually used to match 'DNF', meaning you can exclude components with arbitrary text.
- [int_bom_fil_2.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_fil_2.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use KiCad 5 module attributes (from the PCB) to filter SMD, THT and Virtual components. Note KiCad 6 is redefining the attributes.
- [int_bom_include_only.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_include_only.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use regular expressions to match only some components, instead of including a few.
- [int_bom_var_t2is_csv.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/int_bom_var_t2is_csv.kibot.yaml): Shows how to use filters and variants simultaneously, not a good idea, but possible.
- [print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml): Shows how to change the `dnf_filter` for a KiBoM variant.
- [print_pdf_no_inductors_2.kibot.yaml](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/tree/master/tests/yaml_samples/print_pdf_no_inductors_2.kibot.yaml): Shows how to do what `print_pdf_no_inductors_1.kibot.yaml` does but without the need of a variant.

#### Built-in filters

- **_mechanical** is used to exclude:
  - References that start with #
  - Virtual components
  - References that match: '^TP[0-9]*' or '^FID'
  - Part names that match: 'regex': 'mount.*hole' or 'solder.*bridge' or 'solder.*jump' or 'test.*point'
  - Footprints that match:  'test.*point' or 'mount.*hole' or 'fiducial'
- **_kibom_dnf_Config** it uses the internal `dnf_list` to exclude components with
  - Value matching any of the keys
  - Any of the keys in the `Config` field (comma or space separated)
- **_kibom_dnc_Config** it uses the internal `dnc_list` to exclude components with
  - Value matching any of the keys
  - Any of the keys in the `Config` field (comma or space separated)

Note that the last two uses a field named `Config`, but you can customise them invoking **_kibom_dnf_FIELD**. This will create an equivalent filter, but using the indicated **FIELD**.

#### DNF and DNC internal keys

The current list of **DNF** keys is:
- dnf
- dnl
- dnp
- do not fit
- do not place
- do not load
- nofit
- nostuff
- noplace
- noload
- not fitted
- not loaded
- not placed
- no stuff

The current list of **DNC** keys is:
- dnc
- do not change
- no change
- fixed

You can define your own lists as the `int_bom_fil_1.kibot.yaml` shows.


### The *outputs* section

In this section you put all the things that you want to generate.  This section contains one or more **outputs**. Each output contain the following data:

- `name` a name so you can easily identify it.
- `comment` a short description of this output.
- `type` selects which type of output will be generated. Examples are *gerbers*, *drill files* and *pick & place files*
- `dir` is the directory where this output will be stored.
- `options` contains one or more options to configure this output.
- `layers` a list of layers used for this output. Not all outputs needs this subsection.

**Important note about the layers**: In the original [kiplot](https://github.com/johnbeard/kiplot)
(from [John Beard](https://github.com/johnbeard)) the name of the inner layers was *Inner.N* where
*N* is the number of the layer, i.e. *Inner.1* is the first inner layer.
This format is supported for compatibility.
Note that this generated a lot of confusion because the default KiCad name for the first inner layer
is *In1.Cu*.
People filled issues and submitted pull-requests to fix it, thinking that inner layers weren't supported.
Currently KiCad allows renaming these layers, so this version of kiplot supports the name used in
KiCad. Just use the same name you see in the user interface.

The available values for *type* are:
- Plot formats:
    - `gerber` the gerbers for fabrication.
    - `ps` postscript plot
    - `hpgl` format for laser printers
    - `svg` scalable vector graphics
    - `pdf` portable document format
    - `dxf` mechanical CAD format
- Drill formats:
    - `excellon` data for the drilling machine
    - `gerb_drill` drilling positions in a gerber file
- Pick & place
    - `position` of the components for the pick & place machine
- Documentation
    - `pdf_sch_print` schematic in PDF format
    - `pdf_pcb_print`PDF file containing one or more layer and the page frame
- Bill of Materials
    - `kibom` BoM in HTML or CSV format generated by [KiBoM](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBoM)
    - `ibom` Interactive HTML BoM generated by [InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/InteractiveHtmlBom)
- 3D model:
    - `step` *Standard for the Exchange of Product Data* for the PCB

Here is an example of a configuration file to generate the gerbers for the top and bottom layers:

```yaml
kibot:
  version: 1

preflight:
  run_drc: true

outputs:

  - name: 'gerbers'
    comment: "Gerbers for the board house"
    type: gerber
    dir: gerberdir
    options:
      # generic layer options
      exclude_edge_layer: false
      exclude_pads_from_silkscreen: false
      plot_sheet_reference: false
      plot_footprint_refs: true
      plot_footprint_values: true
      force_plot_invisible_refs_vals: false
      tent_vias: true
      line_width: 0.15

      # gerber options
      use_aux_axis_as_origin: false
      subtract_mask_from_silk: true
      use_protel_extensions: false
      gerber_precision: 4.5
      create_gerber_job_file: true
      use_gerber_x2_attributes: true
      use_gerber_net_attributes: false

    layers:
      - 'F.Cu'
      - 'B.Cu'
```

Most options are the same you'll find in the KiCad dialogs.


#### Specifying the layers

You have various ways to specify the layers. If you need to specify just one layer you can just use its name:

```yaml
    layers: 'F.Cu'
```

If you want to specify all the available layers:

```yaml
    layers: 'all'
```

You can also select the layers you want in KiCad (using File, Plot dialog) and save your PCB.
Then you just need to use:

```yaml
    layers: 'selected'
```

You can also use any of the following grup of layers:

- **copper** all the copper layers
- **technical** all the technical layers (silk sreen, solder mask, paste, adhesive, etc.)
- **user** all the user layers (draw, comments, eco, margin, edge cuts, etc.)

You can also mix the above definitions using a list:

```yaml
    layers:
      - 'copper'
      - 'Dwgs.User'
```

This will select all the copper layers and the user drawings.
Note that the above mentioned options will use file name suffixes and descriptions selected automatically.
If you want to use a particular suffix and provide better descriptions you can use the following format:

```yaml
    layers:
      - layer: 'F.Cu'
        suffix: 'F_Cu'
        description: 'Front copper'
      - layer: 'B.Cu'
        suffix: 'B_Cu'
        description: 'Bottom copper'
```

You can also mix the styles:

```yaml
    layers:
      - 'copper'
      - layer: 'Cmts.User'
        suffix: 'Cmts_User'
        description: 'User comments'
      - 'Dwgs.User'
```

If you need to use the same list of layers for various outputs you can use YAML anchors.
The first time you define the list of layers just assign an ancho, here is an example:

```yaml
    layers: &copper_and_cmts
      - copper
      - 'Cmts.User'
```

Next time you need this list just use an alias, like this:

```yaml
    layers: *copper_and_cmts
```

#### Supported outputs:

* BoM (Bill of Materials)
  * Type: `bom`
  * Description: Used to generate the BoM in CSV, HTML, TSV, TXT, XML or XLSX format using the internal BoM.
                 Is compatible with KiBoM, but doesn't need to update the XML netlist because the components
                 are loaded from the schematic.
                 Important differences with KiBoM output:
                 - All options are in the main `options` section, not in `conf` subsection.
                 - The `Component` column is named `Row` and works just like any other column.
                 This output is what you get from the 'Tools/Generate Bill of Materials' menu in eeschema.
  * Valid keys:
    - `comment`: [string=''] A comment for documentation purposes.
    - `dir`: [string='.'] Output directory for the generated files.
    - `name`: [string=''] Used to identify this particular output definition.
    - `options`: [dict] Options for the `bom` output.
      * Valid keys:
        - `columns`: [list(dict)|list(string)] List of columns to display.
                     Can be just the name of the field.
          * Valid keys:
            - `field`: [string=''] Name of the field to use for this column.
            - `join`: [list(string)|string=''] List of fields to join to this column.
            - `name`: [string=''] Name to display in the header. The field is used when empty.
        - `component_aliases`: [list(list(string))] A series of values which are considered to be equivalent for the part name.
                               Each entry is a list of equivalen names. Example: ['c', 'c_small', 'cap' ]
                               will ensure the equivalent capacitor symbols can be grouped together.
                               If empty the following aliases are used:
                               - ['r', 'r_small', 'res', 'resistor']
                               - ['l', 'l_small', 'inductor']
                               - ['c', 'c_small', 'cap', 'capacitor']
                               - ['sw', 'switch']
                               - ['zener', 'zenersmall']

## Usage

If you need a template for the configuration file try:

```shell
kibot --example
```

This will generate a file named `example.kibot.yaml` containing all the available options and comments about them.
You can use it to create your own configuration file.

If you want to use the layers of a particular PCB in the example use:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE --example
```

And if you want to use the same options selected in the plot dialog use:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE -p --example
```

If the current directory contains only one PCB file and only one configuration file (named *.kibot.yaml)
you can just call `kibot`. No arguments needed. The tool will figure out which files to use.

If more than one file is found in the current directory `kibot` will use the first found and issue a
warning. If you need to use other file just tell it explicitly:

```shell
kibot -b PCB_FILE.kicad_pcb -c CONFIG.kibot.yaml
```

A simple target can be added to your `makefile`, so you can just run
`make pcb_files` or integrate into your current build process.

```Makefile
pcb_files:
    kibot -b $(PCB) -c $(KIBOT_CFG)
```

If you need to supress messages use `--quiet` or `-q` and if you need to get more informatio about
what's going on use `--verbose` or `-v`.

If you want to generate only some of the outputs use:

```shell
kibot OUTPUT_1 OUTPUT_2
```

If you want to generate all outputs with some exceptions use:


```shell
kibot --invert-sel OUTPUT_1 OUTPUT_2
```

If you want to skip the DRC and ERC use:

```shell
kibot --skip-pre run_erc,run_drc
```

If you want to skip all the `preflight` tasks use:

```shell
kibot --skip-pre all
```

All outputs are generated using the current directory as base. If you want to use another
directory as base use:

```shell
kibot --out-dir OTHER_PLACE
```

If you want to list the available outputs defined in the configuration file use:

```shell
kibot --list
```

## Installation

### Dependencies

- For ERC, DRC, BoM XML update and PCB/SCH print install [KiCad Automation Scripts](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-automation-scripts/)
- BoM files (HTML/CSV/TSV/TXT/XML/XLSX) can be generated using the internal BoM generator or using [KiBoM](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBoM).
- For interactive BoM install [InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/InteractiveHtmlBom)
- For SVG/PNG/JPG beauty PCB render [PcbDraw](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/PcbDraw)

### Installation on Ubuntu/Debian

Get the Debian package from the [releases section](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/releases) and run:
```shell
sudo apt install ./kibot*_all.deb
```

**Important note**: Sometimes the release needs another packages that aren't part of the stable Debian distribution.
In this case the packages are also included in the release page. As an example version 0.6.0 needs:

```shell
sudo apt install ./python3-mcpy_2.0.2-1_all.deb ./kibot_0.6.0-1_all.deb
```

### Installation using pip

```shell
pip install --no-compile kibot
```

Note that `pip` has the dubious idea of compiling everything it downloads.
There is no advantage in doing it and it interferes with the `mcpy` macros.

If you are installing at system level I recommend generating the compilation caches after installing.
As `root` just run:

```shell
kibot --help-outputs > /dev/null
```

### Installation on other targets

- Install KiCad 5.x
- Install Python 3.5 or newer
- Install the Python Yaml module
- Run the script *src/kibot*


## Notes about Gerber format

I found this topic poorly documented and quite complex. So here is what I know, feel free to send me any corrections.
Note that this is a very dynamic topic and this text was written in november 2020.

The gerber format is controlled by [Ucamco](https://www.ucamco.com/en/), a leading manufacturer of equipment and software for PCB fabrication.
Even when this isn't an open standard they release the spec for free and interact with Jean-Pierre Charras (father of KiCad).
So KiCad support for gerber format is really updated.

The gerber format evolved with time, here are the versions I know:

* **RS-274D** obsolete version of the format.
* **RS-274X** (aka **X1**) this is the *extended* version of the format. Is the most widely supported, but has some limitations.
* **X2** this is the format currently recommended by Ucamco and the default for modern KiCad versions.
  This extension adds important meta-data to the files. It helps CAM operators to know what's every drawing in the image.
  So you know which are pads, tracks, etc. And also more interesting information: impedance controlled tracks, the role of each file, etc.
  Using X2 you can know what is each file without the need of special names or file extensions.
  KiCad can generate drill files using X2.
* **X3** this is the current draft. One interesting addition is the *Components* role.
  These files replaces the position files, adding important information about the footprint.

In addition to them is the spec for the **Gerber Job** file. This file was introduced between X2 and X3, and is used to group all the gerber files.
The *gbrjob* file contains all the missing stack-up information.

KiCad 5 can generate X1, X2 and gerber job files, including drill information in gerber format.
KiCad 5.99 (6.0 pre-release) can also generate X3 files (position files in gerber format).

As you can see the idea of Ucamco is to unify all fabrication information in one format.

The **X2** format was designed in a way that software that fully implement **X1** can just ignore the added meta-data.
In an ideal world you shouldn't bother about it and generate **X2** files. Just use the **gbr** file extension and a *gbrjob* file.
The problem is with poorly implemented CAM tools. In particular **CAM350**, used by various important cheap China manufacturers.
This software has known issues interpretating aperture macros and some X2 data.
If your manufacturer has problems with your files check the following:

* Put gerber, drill and position files in the same directory.
* Disable **X2** extensions (`use_gerber_x2_attributes` set to `false`)
* Use arcaic role mechanism (`use_protel_extensions` set to `true`)
* Disable **aperture macros** (KiCad 6 only: `disable_aperture_macros` set to `true`)

## Usage for CI/CD

When using a GitHub or GitLab repo you can use KiBot to generate all the needed stuff each time you commit a change to the schematic and/or PCB file.

Examples of how to do it can be found [here for GitHub](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_ci_test) and [here for GitLab](https://gitlab.com/set-soft/kicad-ci-test).

In order to run KiBot on these environments you need a lot of software installed. The usual mechanism to achieve this is using [docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker images containing KiBot, all the supporting scripts and a corresponding KiCad can be found at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as [setsoft/kicad_auto:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_auto). This image is based on [setsoft/kicad_debian:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/setsoft/kicad_debian), containing KiCad on Debian GNU/Linux.

For more information about the docker images visit [kicad_debian](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_debian) and [kicad_auto](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad_auto).


### Usage of Github Actions

You need to put a [config.kibot.yaml](#configuration) file into the KiCad project folder.

Here is an example of workflow file using the GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: example

on:
  push:
    paths:
    - '**.sch'
    - '**.kicad_pcb'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.sch'
      - '**.kicad_pcb'

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: INTI-CMNB/KiBot@v0.7.0
      with:
      # Required - kibot config file
        config: config.kibot.yaml
      # optional - prefix to output defined in config
        dir: output
      # optional - schematic file
        schema: '*.sch'
      # optional - PCB design file
        board: '*.kicad_pcb'
    - name: upload results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: output
        path: output
```
